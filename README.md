<h2 id="maybe-you-are-hwid-banned-">Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️</h2>
<p>Did your ban hit you the second you tried playing with a new account? Or is it following you no matter how many fresh profiles you create? That’s probably an <strong>HWID ban</strong> (Hardware ID ban)! Rockstar has flagged your PC hardware, so even new accounts get hit with the ban hammer.</p>
